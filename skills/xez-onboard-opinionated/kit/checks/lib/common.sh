# ENVIRONMENT WARNING — the reason TASK_ID is derived, not read.
# Xezar exports XEZ_TASK_ID only to the spawned AGENT (agent step environment,
# `packages/xezar/src/workflows/run.ts`, `RunManager.agentEnv`, alongside XEZ_HANDOFF_FILE and
# XEZ_TODOS_FILE). A workflow `command:` step is still spawned with the manager
# process's own environment (`src/workflows/run.ts`, `runCheckStep`), which has no XEZ_TASK_ID.
# Every check step here must therefore work with XEZ_TASK_ID unset. The authoritative
# identity is the worktree directory name, because Xezar names it after the run id.
#
# Xezar source facts encoded here, from the migration compatibility record (the Xezar
# original checkout at 6cd4aaa3605e8bcddf7bafd8f05ac96881ee35cc, package `@qodeca/xezar` 0.10.1;
# directory paths updated for the .xezar/.local layout;
# paths are relative to `packages/xezar/`):
#   - src/git-worktree.ts  worktrees directory = '.local/xezar/worktrees'

# --- Gate evidence --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A fingerprint of everything the gates just judged. It must cover file CONTENT, not just
# which files are dirty: `git status --porcelain` reports the same two lines whether an
# already-modified file was left alone or rewritten from scratch, so a name-and-status
# hash would happily certify a tree the gates never saw.
#
# Three parts, which together cover every non-ignored byte:
#   1. HEAD — binds the evidence to an exact commit;
#   2. `git diff HEAD` — every staged and unstaged change to tracked files, by content;
#   3. the content of every untracked, non-ignored file.
#
# It identifies a REVISION plus working changes. It is not an attestation that any
# command ran, nor that the environment that ran it still exists.
