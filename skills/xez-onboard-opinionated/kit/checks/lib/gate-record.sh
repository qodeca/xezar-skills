# The recording half of the gate evidence contract: run a gate, keep its whole output, and
# write down what actually happened.
#
# Sourced (never executed) by `repo-gates.sh`, and driven directly by the behaviour tests in
# `infra-tests.sh` with synthetic commands — the tests exercise THIS code, not a copy of it,
# and they never call repo-gates.sh back, so there is no recursion.
#
# TWO PROBLEMS IT SOLVES, both observed in production:
#
# 1. Truncation. The gates used to write every command's full output to stdout, and the
#    cockpit truncates a long step's output. On the P1 run the summary at the end was cut off
#    and the whole gate pass had to be re-run to find out what it had said. Here the COMPLETE
#    output goes to a file under the primary checkout's `.local/xezar/`, and only a bounded excerpt
#    reaches stdout — so the verdict is always the part that survives.
#
# 2. Unevidenced passes. A gate's exit status used to exist only in a shell variable that died
#    with the process. Here every command's status, exit code, timing and log digest is written
#    to a record that the sealing step reads instead of assuming.
#
# Logging failure is a gate failure. If the log cannot be opened, the command is not run at all
# and is recorded as `not-run`; if the log is unreadable or its header is gone afterwards, the
# command is recorded with `logOk:false`. Either one makes the whole attempt uncertifiable,
# even where the command itself exited zero — an outcome nobody can read is not evidence.
#
# Expects `resolve_task_paths` (lib/common.sh) to have run.
#
# API:
#   gate_attempt_begin <requiredNamesJson> <commandListId>
#     Records `producer` from `GATE_PRODUCER` (set by `repo-gates.sh --producer`), defaulting to
#     `author`. An author-produced attempt is refused at sealing (#676 PR 2).
#     With no run id the attempt is STANDALONE: it records under
#     `.local/xezar/scratch/standalone-gates/` with `runId: null`, prints a real verdict, and can
#     never be sealed or certified. That is the owner running the gates by hand.
#   gate_run <name> <command> [args…]
#   gate_note_skip <name> <reason>

# --- who produced an attempt (#676 PR 2) ---------------------------------------------------
#
# An attempt records WHO ran the gates, because only the workflow's own `gates` step may
# certify the tree: an author's attempt is the same tree proved to itself, and
# `lib/gate-results.mjs` refuses to seal one. `repo-gates.sh --producer gates` is that
# declaration; without it the producer is the AUTHOR.
#
# ONE migration exception, for the release that introduces the flag. A run created before this
# change holds the OLD `gates` command in its PERSISTED workflow definition — the engine freezes
# that definition at run creation — so its gates step cannot declare itself and would be refused
# as an author run. The engine's runs index names the definition and its workflow; when that
# definition does NOT declare the flag and the workflow FILE does, this producer-less invocation
# from a workflow CHECK step (an agent step carries XEZ_TASK_ID; a check step never does —
# lib/common.sh) is that frozen gates step. Every absent or unreadable input is the AUTHOR, so
# the exception fails closed, and it disappears one release after the flag ships.
#
# `$1` is the value of `repo-gates.sh --producer`, or empty when the flag was absent.
