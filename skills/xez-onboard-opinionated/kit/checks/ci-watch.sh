#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Observe ONE already-identified CI run on the base branch, under a deadline of its own.
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR. The integration role used to do this waiting inside its agent turn: the
# session stayed open, tokens were spent on a loop that needs no judgement, and nothing bounded
# it. The observation itself is a command that ends when CI ends, so it belongs in a check step —
# The engine's `runCheckStep` spawns a check with no agent session and
# no tokens. It still runs inside the run's own slot (`run.ts:3735`), so what is saved is tokens,
# a parked session and an unbounded wait; a workspace slot is NOT freed.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never merges, never pushes, never reruns a job and never writes to
# GitHub. It reads one run and records what it saw. Every decision that follows — flake or real
# red, rerun or revert or forward-fix — belongs to the agent step after it, which is where
# `XEZ:ASK` is still live and where the leader's `execution_control` `send_message` can reach a
# session at all.
#
# THE BOUND LIVES HERE. A check step may not carry `timeout` (`workflows/types.ts`, the refine
# beside `stepTimeoutSchema` refuses it), so the wall clock is this script's own: `--deadline`,
# 45 minutes by default. `timeout(1)` does not exist on macOS, so the bound is a poll loop over a
# child PID we started ourselves. Nothing here is killed by command-line pattern: `pkill -f` would
# match every peer agent on this machine (see `.xezar/CLAUDE.md`).
#
# THE INPUT. The merge step records its target as JSON under the task's evidence directory:
#
#   <evidence>/ci-watch/target.json
#   {"runId":"35369683346","repo":"owner/name","base":"main","mergeSha":"<40 hex>","pr":661}
#
# `mergeSha` and `pr` are optional context carried into the outcome record. A missing, unreadable,
# malformed or out-of-shape target is a REFUSAL, not a guess: this script never discovers a run id
# for itself, because guessing one is how a merge gets judged by somebody else's CI run.
#
# THE OUTPUT. `<evidence>/ci-watch/outcome.json`, plus a human-readable verdict on stdout. The
# outcome carries the observed conclusion verbatim, so the agent after it reads a fact rather than
# this script's opinion of one.
#
# EXIT CODES, AND THE ONE PLACE THE POLICY LIVES (`exit_for_outcome` at the bottom).
#   0  success           CI finished green
#   0  cancelled         CI was cancelled — usually superseded by a later push; see supersededBy
#   0  failure           CI finished red, observed and recorded; the agent step adjudicates
#   2  target.missing / target.invalid
#   3  unobservable      `gh` could not answer, or the run is not in a terminal state
#   4  deadline          the observation window elapsed with the run still going
#
# A red CI exits 0 ON PURPOSE, and this is the one place this script departs from the brief that
# asked for it. A non-zero check step with no `onFail` ends the run (`run.ts`, the break after
# `finishStep(... 'failed' ...)`), so exiting non-zero on red would mean the report step never
# runs: no flake adjudication, no `XEZ:ASK`, no question to the leader at the only moment
# integration ever needs one — and `onFail.retry` cannot help, because every step earlier than
# this one is earlier than the merge, so retrying would re-run the merge. Red is therefore
# OBSERVED (exit 0, outcome `failure`) and judged by the agent; unobservable and out-of-time are
# the failures, because those are the states in which there is nothing to report.
#
# GitHub is reached through one indirection, `$DOGFOOD_GH` (default `gh`), so the boundary can be
# driven by a stub in `infra-tests.sh`. There is no other network call in this file.
