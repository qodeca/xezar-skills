# The only way a review or QA step runs the change it judges (DECISIONS.md, D13).
#
# A review step (code-review, security-review, architecture-review, qa, design-review,
# acceptance-verification) holds no Edit and no Write, and its `bashAllowlist` is the kit's reading
# set plus this script. So it may RUN the pull request – check its head out in this run's own
# worktree, install, run the tests and the build, start a dev server – but it has no git or gh
# command that commits, pushes, resets or moves to another branch. Running a PR's code means
# running whatever that code does, so the allowlist is not the boundary; the boundary is the check
# before the verdict: `verdict-write.sh` runs `finish`, which fails when the worktree's tracked
# files or its HEAD differ from the head that was reviewed, and then the verdict is refused. Build caches, installed dependencies and
# gitignored output do not count.
#
# Usage:
#   review-run.sh checkout <pr-number>        check the PR's head out, detached, in THIS worktree,
#                                             and record it as the reviewed head (once per run)
#   review-run.sh install                     install dependencies here (deps-restore.sh)
#   review-run.sh run <program> [<args>…]     run one project command here, in the foreground
#   review-run.sh start <name> <program> […]  start one long-running command (a dev server) in the
#                                             background; its log is <evidence>/review/<name>.log
#   review-run.sh stop [<name>]               stop one started command, or all of them
#   review-run.sh verify-unchanged            exit 0 only when the tracked tree equals the
#                                             reviewed head (below); prints review-tree=<status>
#   review-run.sh finish                      stop everything started, then verify-unchanged –
#                                             verdict-write.sh runs this before a packet
#
# Which copy runs. A checkout replaces the tracked `.xezar/checks/` with the PR head's own copies:
# old ones, missing ones, or ones the PR changed. So a review step never runs a kit script from
# there. The kit step copies the primary checkout's scripts to `.local/xezar/cache/kit/checks/`
# (outside the tracked tree), and a review step's `bashAllowlist` names only those copies, this
# script included: `bash .local/xezar/cache/kit/checks/review-run.sh`. Everything it calls in turn
# (`deps-restore.sh`, `lib/common.sh`) is beside it. Git overwrites an ignored file on checkout, so
# a head that tracks a file under `.local/xezar/cache/kit/` is refused: the checkout is undone and
# the copies are made again from the primary checkout.
#
# The reviewed head: the one `checkout` recorded; without a checkout, HEAD must be the run's own
# branch with no commit of its own (an ancestor of the base branch, local or origin).
#
# Refused as <program>: git and gh (their writing subcommands are exactly what a reviewer may not
# run – read through git-read.sh and gh pr view/diff instead), sudo/su, and every shell or wrapper
# that would run another program unseen (bash, sh, zsh, dash, env, eval, exec, xargs, nohup,
# command, timeout, nice) – any case, either path separator, with or without .exe/.cmd/.bat/.com;
# a short 8.3 name is refused. Never the project's main checkout: this script refuses to run there.
#
# The name list is a courtesy, not the boundary: `node -e`, `python3 -c`, `make`, a test suite or
# an npm lifecycle script can start git or gh all the same. So what `install`, `run` and `start`
# start gets NO git or gh credentials: GH_TOKEN and GITHUB_TOKEN (and the enterprise pair) are set
# to a value GitHub refuses, GH_CONFIG_DIR is an empty directory, git's credential helpers are
# reset, askpass and terminal prompts fail, SSH has no agent and no ssh command. A git or gh the
# child starts therefore cannot push, merge or label. What it does NOT stop: the child is still
# arbitrary code with the operator's user rights, so a program written to do it can read a
# credential store (the keychain, ~/.config/gh) directly. That residue is accepted in D13.
#
# The reviewed head is recorded in <evidence>/review/head, which a child can rewrite as well. So
# verify-unchanged also asks GitHub – with this script's own credentials, which the child never
# had – whether the recorded head is a commit of the recorded pull request. A head the review made
# up locally is not, and is refused; so is a checkout whose head record was removed.
#
# A sandbox that cannot write git. A checkout writes the worktree's own git directory and the
# primary checkout's shared one (objects, refs), and both live outside the task worktree. A backend
# that confines a reading step to the worktree plus the run's own folders – engine 0.19.0 runs a
# Codex step with no Edit and no Write in `workspace-write` with exactly those writable roots –
# cannot write them, so `checkout` probes both first and, when either is closed, exits 3 with
# `review-run=confined` instead of failing half-way. Nothing of the PR can run in that step: judge
# from the diff and report every check that needed running as not run (an evidence limit).
#
# Exit: the command's own status for `run`; 0 ok, 1 refused or changed, 2 usage, 3 confined
# (`checkout` only: this step's sandbox cannot write git, so the PR cannot be checked out here).
