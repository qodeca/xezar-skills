# Xezar project gates: the AGENTS/SDLC/.xezar/pipeline/config.json sequence,
# with dependency freshness and actual repository checks. UI smoke is separate.
# Usage:  .xezar/checks/repo-gates.sh [--fast] [--list] [--producer <author|gates>]
#   --producer <author|gates>
#           WHO ran the gates. The workflow's own `gates` step passes `gates`; an invocation
#           without the flag is the AUTHOR's, and `lib/gate-results.mjs` refuses to seal an
#           author's attempt. It is deliberately NOT part of the command-list id: the id names
#           the LIST of gates, and who invoked it is not a gate.
#   --fast  skip `npm ci` ONLY when the installed dependencies
#           still match the manifests. `--fast` is a request, not a promise: freshness is
#           verified against a fingerprint of package-lock.json, npm-shrinkwrap.json, root/workspace package.json,
#           .npmrc, patches/ and the Node/npm versions, and a stale or missing stamp installs anyway.
#           "node_modules exists" is deliberately NOT the test — an agent that touched the
#           lockfile mid-run leaves node_modules stale, and judging that tree would be a
#           false green.
#   --list  print the canonical gate list and its command-list id, and exit. Nothing runs.
#           The id is what binds a sealed result to the list it was produced by, so a gate
#           added or removed later cannot be quietly back-dated onto an older attempt.
#
# Exit 0 only when every gate ran AND passed. A gate that could not run counts as a
# failure, never as a pass.
#
# EVIDENCE. Every run records a gate attempt under the PRIMARY checkout at
# `.local/xezar/tasks/<runId>/gates/<headSha>/<attemptId>/`: one complete log per gate plus a
# versioned result record carrying each command's status, exit code, timing and log digest.
# The complete output goes to those logs; only a bounded excerpt reaches stdout, so a long
# gate can no longer push the summary out of a truncated cockpit view. The `evidence` step
# then READS that record. It does not assert a pass — see `lib/gate-results.mjs`.

# Data, not control flow, so one place answers "which gates are required" for the runner, for
# `--list`, for the command-list id and for the sealing check. Commands are written
# repo-relative on purpose: an absolute path would make the id differ between checkouts and
# no two machines could ever agree that they ran the same list.
#
# The security stage sits at position TWO, immediately after the install and before every gate
# that produces a quality signal. That placement is the contract, not a preference: SDLC.md
# § Security before the quality verdict requires the security result to be resolved before
# anyone gives a quality verdict, and putting it in the list's order is what makes the runner
# execute the rule rather than ask people to remember it. It is a kit check, like
# `repository-checks.sh`, so `.xezar/pipeline/config.json`'s `validation.commands` — the five npm
# commands a person runs by hand — is unchanged and still matches this list in order.

# --- One gate run per machine, by default -----------------------------------------------------
#
# Two full gate runs on one machine starve each other, and they fail in suites the change under
# test never touched. Measured on the engine's own machine: attempt failure was 20% with one
# concurrent run, 37% at three, 90% at four to five and 100% at six or more. Those are that
# machine's numbers on that machine's suite, and the two worst buckets rest on single-digit
# samples - do not quote them as a law. What they establish is the SHAPE: the cliff is steep and
# it arrives early. This kit makes it arrive earlier than most, because one gate run of its own
# already fans out - `GATE_APPLICATION_LANES` defaults to three lanes, so two runs is six
# processes.
#
# So the whole run re-executes itself once, holding one of the machine's gate slots. How many run
# together is the engine's `resources.gateSlots`, default 1; the wait is bounded at 20 minutes and
# the engine prints both a notice at 30 seconds and the wait it actually paid.
#
# WHY A RE-EXEC AND NOT A LOCK AROUND THE PHASES. The lease is held for the lifetime of the
# process it wraps, so it is released when this script exits - by any path, including a kill or
# the security stage's early stop. (This file sets `set -uo pipefail` and deliberately not
# `set -e`, so there is no `set -e` abort to be had.) A lock taken inside the script would need an
# EXIT trap to match, and a released-only-on-the-happy-path lease is worse than none: the next run
# on this machine queues behind one that finished minutes ago.
#
# The slot files live at a fixed machine-wide path (`~/.cache/xez/gate-slots/`) in every engine
# layout, so runs in DIFFERENT projects contend against the same slots. That is the point.
#
# FAIL OPEN, ALWAYS - AND THE PROBES ARE WHAT MAKE THAT TRUE. `exec` replaces this script, so
# after it there is no code of ours left to fall back to: every later failure would reach the
# caller AS THE GATE VERDICT, with no gates run and an exit code indistinguishable from a real
# gate failure. So nothing is committed until a probe has proved this binary can actually run the
# verb with the flags used below. From engine 0.19.0 that check is the engine's own published one:
# `lease gates --probe` prints `{"lease":{"gates":true},"slots":<n>}` and exits 0, takes no slot and
# writes no file, and older engines refuse the flag (xezar #866, `862ec8fa`). Before 0.19.0 there is
# no probe, so the old check stays for those engines: `lease gates` with no command after `--` exits
# 2 with a refusal WITHOUT taking a slot, and its `nothing to run` phrase is the one the engine's own
# suite asserts. A fork that does not know the verb, an engine too old for the flags, and an engine
# that dies during boot on a bad setting or a truncated workspace.json all fail both, and we run
# unleased instead. Never match the `usage:` text: the engine declares that wording NOT a contract.
#
# Two fail-open paths are ours and proven here; the other two - an unwritable slot folder and a
# lease that times out - are the engine's contract and are not exercised by this script.
#
# TWO LIMITS THIS SIDE CANNOT CLOSE, written down rather than left to be discovered.
#   - SIGKILL of the WRAPPER does not stop the gates. The engine spawns this script as a child,
#     so killing the engine outright skips its release AND orphans a full gate run: the slot is
#     recovered by pid liveness and handed to a waiter while the orphan is still loading the
#     machine - the very over-subscription the lease exists to prevent. Killing the gate run
#     itself is clean; it is only a kill aimed at the wrapper that leaks. Before the lease the
#     supervisor's direct child WAS this script, so this is a cost the lease introduced.
#   - `XEZ_GATE_LEASE` set in a shell profile or a CI environment disables leasing for every run
#     in that environment. It is a re-entry guard, not a designed opt-out, and the engine states
#     it deliberately offers no env var to turn leasing off.

# Security first, alone, and before any quality gate. A failing security stage stops the run
# here: there is no point paying for a build to find out what the scan already refused, and a
# quality verdict given ahead of the security result is the order this exists to prevent.
#
# `gate_phase` returns non-zero only for an INFRASTRUCTURE failure — a non-zero scheduler, or a
# worker whose result could not be collected. A security gate that RAN and refused the candidate
# exits 1 and records `failed`, and the phase still returns 0, so this stage used to fall
# straight through to the five quality gates (#680). The stage's own recorded outcome is the
# boundary that was missing.
#
# This arm reads the GATE-WORKER vocabulary, which is all `workers/2.json` ever carries:
# `gate_collect_worker` validates that file to exactly `passed` / `failed` / `not-run`, so `passed`
# is the only value that continues and `failed` and `not-run` both stop. The security-result
# vocabulary (`pass` / `findings` / `unknown` / `not-applicable`) lives in `security.json` and must
# never be read here: `pass` is one letter from `passed`, so a "more accurate" re-point would stop
# every clean run. `unknown` deliberately does not stop the run — it is a resolved security
# outcome, not a refusal, and `security-scan.sh` exits 0 for it (#691).
