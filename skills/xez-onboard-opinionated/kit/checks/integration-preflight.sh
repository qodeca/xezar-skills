# Read-only verification of ONE explicitly named integration target.
#
# This script decides nothing and changes nothing. It answers a single question — "is every
# precondition for merging this exact pull request into this exact base true, right now?" — and
# prints a verdict a human or an integration agent then acts on. It never merges, never pushes,
# never closes an issue and never writes to GitHub. `.xezar/skills/xezar-integration.md` is the
# procedure; this is the gate in front of it.
#
# WHY IT REFUSES DEFAULTS. Every target is a required argument with no fallback. A merge helper
# that guesses its repository, its PR number, its base or its head is one stale variable away from
# integrating the wrong thing, and the blast radius is a shared branch. `--expected-head` in
# particular is the anti-race: the PR head is re-read here and compared, so a push that lands
# between review and merge is a refusal rather than a surprise.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT DO. It matches FACTS, never AUTHORITY. It can confirm that an authority record
# exists, names this PR and this head, and is well-formed. It cannot confirm that whoever wrote it
# was entitled to. Nothing this script prints is permission to merge, and a green verdict is not a
# decision — see `verdict` at the bottom, which says so out loud.
#
# F-PROT-01 (observed 2026-09-08, campaign 20260908-r3). The legacy
# `repos/{o}/{r}/branches/{b}/protection` endpoint answers 404 on this repository while `main`
# is in fact protected by an active ruleset. A 404 there means "this legacy endpoint has nothing to
# say", NOT "the branch is unprotected". Effective rules are read from
# `repos/{o}/{r}/rules/branches/{b}`, and a permission failure is reported as UNAVAILABLE — never
# as "none". Refusing to distinguish those two is how a protected branch gets treated as open.
#
# Branch-enforced contexts and this project's delivery contract are DIFFERENT requirements. GitHub
# enforces a subset; passing only that subset does not waive the rest. Both are checked.
#
# GitHub is reached through one indirection, `$DOGFOOD_GH` (default `gh`), so the boundary can be
# driven by a stub in the test suite. There is no other network call in this file.

# This project's delivery contract: every job in .github/workflows/ci.yml, named EXACTLY as the
# check-runs API reports it.
#
# F-A1, 2026-09-09 (#116 review). These are check-RUN names, which are not always the job id. The
# `integration` job is reported as **`integration / integration`** — a reusable/nested workflow
# renders as `<caller> / <job>` — and the first version of this list carried the bare job id. The
# consequence was a FALSE REFUSAL: a check that had actually passed was reported `checks.absent`,
# and integration would have been blocked on a green build.
#
# The fix is the exact real name, NOT substring matching. Loosening the comparison would let
# `verify` match `verify-something-else` and would trade a visible false refusal for an invisible
# false pass, which is the far worse failure here. The CI job ids and `ci.yml` are unchanged; only
# this list, which describes what the API returns, was wrong.
#
# `integration / integration` is credential-gated. It may report `success` with its assertions
# skipping internally, or `skipped` outright — both are legitimate, and `skipped` is reported as
# its own fourth word, never folded into "all green".
#
# F-A2, 2026-09-10 (#147, folded into #128). `ci.yml` used to be ONE job named `Unit, build, E2E,
# and package`. #128 (issue #60) splits it in two: `verify` is renamed to `Typecheck, unit tests,
# build, and package` (it never ran a browser, so the old name over-promised) and a new `ui-e2e`
# job named `Cockpit browser e2e` runs the 35 cockpit browser specs. Both are top-level jobs of
# `ci.yml`, so neither renders as `<caller> / <job>`.
#
# This list HAD to move in the same commit as that rename, which is why #147 never got a pull
# request of its own. The sequencing has no safe gap: landing the list first would require two
# checks `main` does not yet produce, and landing it afterwards leaves a window in which the old
# name exists on no run at all. Either way every merge through this gate is refused, because a
# name that no run reports is `checks.absent` and absent is a refusal — correctly so, and that
# refusal is deliberately NOT relaxed here. No fallback, no wildcard, no override: the only fix
# for a renamed check is to state its new real name.
#
# Both names were read from the check-runs API on #128's own rebased head, never from `ci.yml`,
# for the reason F-A1 records above.
# The fixture split adds a third unconditional check; old task snapshots must reconcile it.

# --- 7. Checks at the exact head ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Two distinct requirements. GitHub enforces a subset; this project expects all of PROJECT_CHECKS.
# Passing the enforced subset does not waive the rest, and pending is pending — never a pass.
#
# F-A7, 2026-09-10 (#180). ONE COMMIT CARRIES MANY RUNS OF ONE NAME, and this block used to read
# only the first the API happened to return (`$1==n{print; exit}`). Two ordinary things produce
# duplicates: `gh run rerun` creates a NEW check run rather than mutating the old one, and the same
# SHA reachable from two refs gets an independent run per ref. The check-runs endpoint documents no
# ordering guarantee, so "first returned" was neither the newest nor the worst — it was arbitrary,
# and an arbitrary pick can hand back an older `success` while the newest run is red. That is a
# FALSE PASS, the one direction this file exists to prevent, and unlike F-A1's false refusal it is
# invisible: the gate simply prints `check <name>: success` and the merge proceeds.
#
# Observed on `46553b9151f9e916a219e38534b0085b07608642`: six runs, three named `Cockpit browser
# e2e`, started 13:23:14 (failure), 13:32:07 (success) and 13:39:16 (success) UTC.
#
# THE RULE: per required NAME, the NEWEST run by `started_at` decides — but only once every run of
# that name has finished.
#
#   1. no run of that name          -> checks.absent   (unchanged; absent is a refusal)
#   2. ANY run of that name unfinished -> checks.pending
#   3. otherwise the newest by `started_at` supplies the conclusion, read exactly as before
#   4. anything that makes 2/3 undecidable -> checks.ambiguous
#
# Why newest-wins and not "every run must be green": a re-run after a genuinely red run is a
# workflow this project uses (see #177, a flaky browser job), and "all green" would mean a SHA that
# ever went red could never merge without being rewritten — that is a false refusal with no escape,
# traded for a false pass. It is close to what a human reading the Checks tab concludes, and it is
# NOT a claim of equivalence with GitHub's own required-status-checks: that machinery can pin an
# expected app per context, and this one cannot (see G3 below). Do NOT "fix" a future complaint here
# by taking the first `success` found: that is the bug #180 named, and it is the one shape that is
# strictly worse than what was here before.
#
# Why rule 2 is "ANY unfinished" rather than "the newest is unfinished": an unfinished run can still
# go red, and waiting is a refusal that CLEARS BY ITSELF in minutes — the cheapest possible
# conservative answer. It also keeps `absent` and `pending` the distinct words they already were.
#
# FAILING CLOSED is the whole point, so every undecidable shape refuses rather than falling through:
# a `started_at` missing or unparseable on any run that is being ordered, several newest runs tied
# at the same instant with DIFFERENT conclusions, or a body whose shape is not what the API
# documents. A tie whose conclusions AGREE is not undecidable and is accepted — the order cannot
# change the answer. Grouping happens once, in node, and emits exactly ONE resolved line per
# distinct name, which is what makes the `exit` in the two lookups below correct again.
#
# READING THE WHOLE HISTORY IS PART OF THE SAME BUG, and the rule above is what makes it
# load-bearing. Two separate things reduce what one request returns, and BOTH of them could always
# hand back an older green — the old first-match reader was no safer here, it simply picked
# arbitrarily from whatever subset arrived:
#
#   `filter` — G1, 2026-09-10 (#186 review). The endpoint's DEFAULT is `filter=latest`, which is a
#   different selection rule from this one: it reduces by COMPLETION time and by check suite, while
#   the policy above claims to inspect every run and order by `started_at`. A response already
#   narrowed by someone else's rule cannot evidence "every run of that name". Measured on
#   `46553b9151f9e916a219e38534b0085b07608642`: the default answers 6 runs, `filter=all` answers 10.
#   The four it hides are older browser failures (`102883935449`, `102887870384`) and duplicate
#   `Typecheck…` records from check suite `93406922306`. At that observation the later runs are all
#   green, so this is proof of HIDDEN INPUT, not a demonstrated bad merge — but the program cannot
#   enforce a policy over a set it never received. `filter=all` is therefore requested explicitly.
#
#   pages — the endpoint pages, defaulting to 30, and one request returns one page. `per_page=100`
#   is asked for and the `total_count` the endpoint reports is compared against what actually
#   arrived; a short read is UNREADABLE, never a verdict on the runs that did arrive. This is a
#   COMPLETENESS CHECK with a disclosed ceiling, not pagination support: a commit carrying more than
#   100 runs refuses rather than being read across pages. No `--paginate` — it concatenates page
#   bodies into a stream that is not one JSON document, and an explicit refusal is worth more here
#   than a multi-request read that has to be got right.
#
# Both belong to the request, so a fixture that only proves a request REACHED the resource proves
# nothing about either; `infra-tests.sh` records the raw query and serves a deliberately narrowed
# body to any request that omits `filter=all`.
