# SessionStart hook for the project leader session: load the leader guide and the live campaign
# notes into the session at start and after every context compaction.
#
# Prints exactly one JSON hook payload, or nothing at all. The hook is for the LEADER session in
# the primary checkout; a task agent must never receive it, because the guide is irrelevant to the
# work a task was given. It therefore stays silent:
#   - in a linked worktree (`--git-dir` differs from `--git-common-dir`), which is where every
#     task runs by default;
#   - when the path itself is a task worktree (`/.local/xezar/worktrees/`);
#   - whenever the engine set `XEZ_HANDOFF_FILE`, `XEZ_TODOS_FILE` or `XEZ_TASK_ID` for this
#     process, which covers a Worktree-OFF task running in the primary checkout. `XEZ_TASK_ID` is
#     the one that is unconditional and always non-empty; `XEZ_TODOS_FILE` is set to an EMPTY
#     string when follow-ups are off, and an empty value reads as absent here, so it is not a
#     signal on its own;
#   - when the guide file is missing, so an older checkout degrades to no output rather than an
#     error.
#   - when the session was not started by the launcher (`XEZAR_LEADER` is not `1`). While an
#     onboarding is unfinished it prints one fixed line instead, in every session.
#
# Exit status is always 0: a hook that fails must not break session start. The escaping is done
# by node, so no guide or note text can produce malformed JSON.

# The live campaign folder under .xezar/campaigns, if one exists. Four rules, all load-bearing:
#
#   - Chosen by NAME, not by modification time. Folders carry a compact start date
#     (`20260817-amber-ridge`), so the name is the sort key. Reading, grepping or copying an old
#     campaign no longer promotes it to "current", which is exactly what a newest-modified lookup
#     does - it silently loads a finished campaign as the live one.
#   - Only digit-prefixed names are candidates. The reserved `future-campaign/` holds work aimed
#     at a campaign that has not opened yet. It sorts after every `2026...` name, so an unfiltered
#     lookup would pick it every single time. It is excluded by shape, not by remembering a name.
#   - DIRECTORIES ONLY, and a non-directory must not veto the election. A stray `20260901-recap.md`
#     beside the folders sorts last; picking it and then discovering it is not a directory would
#     load NO campaign at all, silently - the worst outcome this script can produce. So walk the
#     candidates newest-first and take the first one that is a real directory.
#   - No symlinks, anywhere. Campaign folders are COMMITTED, so a pull request can deliver a
#     symlink, and this script prints what it finds into a privileged agent session. A symlinked
#     campaign folder or note is a request to read an arbitrary file on this machine. Refuse by
#     shape rather than by trying to judge the target.
#   - A candidate must actually CARRY something. A folder whose every note is missing or is a
#     symlink yields an empty record, and an empty record is indistinguishable from "no campaign
#     is open" - so it must not win the election and silence a real campaign behind it. Since the
#     highest name wins and anyone who can open a pull request can choose a name, an empty
#     `99999999-x/` would otherwise be a one-line way to blind the leader.
